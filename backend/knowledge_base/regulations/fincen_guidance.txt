## SAR Narrative Best Practices

### Structure
Every SAR narrative should follow a three-part structure:
1. INTRODUCTION — Purpose, type of activity, prior SARs, internal reference
2. BODY — Detailed facts addressing Who, What, When, Where, Why, How
3. CONCLUSION — Summary, actions taken, contact info, document references

### The 5Ws + How Framework
- WHO: Identify subjects, account holders, beneficiaries, third parties
- WHAT: Describe suspicious transactions, instruments, amounts
- WHEN: Dates, timeframes, single event vs. pattern
- WHERE: Locations, branches, jurisdictions, foreign involvement
- WHY: Explain why activity is suspicious given customer profile
- HOW: Method of operation, transaction mechanisms

### Writing Guidelines
- Write for law enforcement audience
- Be clear, concise, and factual
- Avoid internal jargon and acronyms (or define them)
- Do not repeat data already in SAR form fields
- Include relevant keywords for searchability
- Link all claims to specific evidence

### Filing Requirements
- File within 30 calendar days of initial detection
- Retain SAR and supporting documentation for 5 years
- Do not disclose SAR filing to the subject
